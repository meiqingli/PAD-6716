# PAD-6716
Python geospatial analytics materials for PAD 6716 Information Systems for Public Administrators and Planners

For this course, we will utilize [Google CoLab](https://colab.google/) for conducting geospatial analysis in Python. 

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize different forms of geospatial data and coordinate reference system (CRS).
- Use `GeoPandas` and `matplotlib` libraries to map and analyze spatial data.
- Apply more advanced Python libraries for interactive visualization.
- Choose domain-specific spatial datasets to create your own maps.

## Google CoLab Instructions
There is no other requirement than having an active Google account. Once you have it, you can open the "PAD_6716_Python_Geospatial_Demo.ipynb" notebook by clicking the "Open in Colab" button on the top. It is recommended that you also sign up for a GitHub account to save your notebooks.
